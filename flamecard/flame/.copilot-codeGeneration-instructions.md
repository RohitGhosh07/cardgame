# Klondike Card Game - Code Generation Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Klondike Solitaire card game built using Flutter and the Flame game engine. The game implements the classic solitaire gameplay where cards are dealt from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on the table, and the player must then move and reveal cards according to the rules to build up four foundation piles in ascending order by suit.

## Architecture

### Core Game Components
- **KlondikeGame**: Extends `FlameGame` and serves as the main game class. It contains game constants, properties, and the overall game state.
- **KlondikeWorld**: Implements the `World` interface and manages the game world, including card dealing, pile setup, and win conditions.

### Card Components
- **Card**: The main card component that handles rendering, interactions (drag and tap), animations, and card state (face up/down).
- **Rank**: Represents the rank of a card (Ace through King).
- **Suit**: Represents the suit of a card (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).

### Pile Components
- **Pile**: An abstract interface defining behavior for card piles in the game.
- **StockPile**: The deck of face-down cards that can be drawn from.
- **WastePile**: Where cards from the stock pile are placed after being drawn.
- **FoundationPile**: The four piles where cards are ultimately placed in ascending order by suit.
- **TableauPile**: The seven columns of cards dealt at the start of the game.

### UI Components
- **FlatButton**: A simple button component for game controls.

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **Flame Game Pattern**: Follow the Flame game engine patterns, particularly the component-based architecture.

2. **Class Structure**:
   - Use private fields with leading underscores
   - Group methods by functionality using region comments (e.g., `//#region Pile API`)
   - Follow the Flutter style guide for UI components

3. **Card Rendering**:
   - Cards are rendered using sprites from a sprite sheet
   - Use the established constants for card dimensions and positioning

4. **Game Logic**:
   - Game rules are enforced through the pile classes
   - Cards can only be moved according to standard solitaire rules

5. **Animation**:
   - Use Flame's effect system for card movements and flips
   - Follow the established timing conventions for animations

## When Generating Code

### Do:
- Use the existing sprite sheet (`klondike-sprites.png`) for card faces and suits
- Maintain the established card dimensions and layout
- Ensure new code follows the existing component structure
- Implement proper validation for card moves according to Klondike rules
- Use the existing effects system for animations

### Don't:
- Change the fundamental structure of the game components
- Modify the established game constants without good reason
- Implement new UI components that don't match the existing style
- Bypass the pile system for card management

## Asset Information
- The sprite sheet (`klondike-sprites.png`) contains all card faces, suits, and ranks
- Card dimensions are defined in KlondikeGame class constants

## Extending The Game
When adding new features:

1. For new card interactions, extend the existing Card class
2. For new game modes, consider creating variant World classes
3. For UI additions, follow the minimalist style of existing components
4. For new animations, use the Flame effects system

## Testing
When generating code that modifies game logic, ensure it maintains:
- Proper card movement restrictions
- Correct card rendering in all states
- Win condition validation
- Game state persistence between deals

This project uses Flame's component architecture extensively - keep any generated code aligned with this pattern.
